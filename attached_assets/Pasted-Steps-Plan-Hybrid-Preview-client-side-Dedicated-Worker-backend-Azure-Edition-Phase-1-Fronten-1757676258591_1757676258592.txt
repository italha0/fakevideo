Steps Plan: Hybrid (Preview client-side + Dedicated Worker backend, Azure Edition)
Phase 1 — Frontend (Preview Mode)

Use Remotion Player in Next.js.

Add <Player> component for instant preview.

User edits messages / theme → Player updates in real-time.

✅ No backend load → free preview.

Save composition JSON (user config: messages, avatars, colors, timestamps).

Send JSON in API request when user clicks Download.

Phase 2 — Backend API (Render Request)

Expose /api/render (Next.js API route or small Express server).

Input: compositionJson, resolution, preset.

Save job in Supabase DB → status=pending.

Return: jobId.

Expose /api/render/:jobId/status

Response: { status: "pending|rendering|done|failed", url }.

Phase 3 — Worker (Azure VM)

Set up Azure VM (B2s: 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM → ~$20/mo, free if you have $200 Azure credits).

Install Docker + Node.js + Chromium deps.

Install Redis (for job queue).

Worker process:

Subscribes to Redis queue (bullmq).

On new job:

Run @remotion/renderer → render video using JSON.

Upload video to Azure Blob Storage (instead of DO Spaces).

Update Supabase DB → status=done, url=SignedURL.

Dockerize worker:

Create Dockerfile with Node, Remotion, Chromium.

Deploy container on VM with docker-compose.

Phase 4 — Storage (Azure Blob Storage)

Create an Azure Storage Account.

Make a videos container.

Worker uploads rendered video → Blob Storage.

Generate SAS URL (signed URL, 1h expiry).

Return signed download URL to frontend.

Phase 5 — Frontend Download Flow

User clicks Download.

Call /api/render → get jobId.

Show progress UI (Rendering video… ⏳).

Poll /api/render/:jobId/status.

Once status=done → show Download Now button with Blob signed URL.

Phase 6 — Optimizations

Quota system → Supabase row: daily_renders. Limit free tier to 5/day.

Watermark free users → Add watermark layer in Remotion comp.

Compression → Encode 720p, ~2 Mbps bitrate (small file size).

Auto-cleanup → Delete blobs older than 7 days (Azure Lifecycle Policies).

Phase 7 — Monitoring

Log jobs in Supabase.

Use Azure Monitor → track CPU, memory on VM.

Add Sentry for worker errors.

⚡ Flow Recap (Azure Version)

User edits → preview with Remotion Player (browser).

On download → JSON sent to API → saved in Supabase.

Worker on Azure VM renders → uploads to Azure Blob.

Frontend polls → shows signed SAS URL for download.

🔥 Big Win: Azure Blob Storage + SAS tokens is cleaner and cheaper than DO Spaces, and Azure credits can cover both storage + VM.
